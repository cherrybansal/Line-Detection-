# Line-Detection
Importance of detecting lines in an image whether be it straight lines or tables was established as these lines cause a major drawback in recognizing words.

The approach used was to minimize any type of unnecessary information or ‘pixel’ from an image so that the necessary information is retrieved with minimum error.
In the case of medical bills, this unnecessary information comprised of lines, salt, and pepper
noise and any noise in particular.
